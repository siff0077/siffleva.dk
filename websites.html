She is an artist and a graphic designer.<br> <br> For our 2nd semester exam my studygroup and I took on the callenge of creating a website for her newly started company. V-Studio didn't have any online presence - Andreea wanted the website to portray her as a graphic designer and communicate her skills to potentiel clients.<br> <br>On of the critirias for the project was to create a video either for the website or as a SoMe-element. We chose to create a video, which was to be placed on V-Studios future LinkedIn profile, but we also created a little splash-video for the website to personalize the site and engaged potentiel costumers. <br> <br></p>

                    <p class="text">This was my first portfolio, which I made for my 1st semester exam. I went for a fresh and playful look, which I think I manage to create. I made several user-tests to make sure I got the expression right. <br> <br> The portfolio contains all my projects from my 1st semester on Multimediadesign. The site is made mainly with HTML and CSS, it only uses JavaScript to control the burgermenu with 'toggle'.<br> <br> The portfolio has some flaws, which should be corrected, if I were to use it. Eg. the text on the frontpage should not be as wide as the full view-width, the responsiveness of the website could also be corrected a bit, especially for bigger viewports.<br> <br> </p>
