                    <p class="text">This is a "click"-game, which was made as a school project on my 1st semester. THe 4ht theme of the semester was 'Animation' and this was the final assignment.<br> <br>I chose to do a game, which took place in Løkken, Nordjylland. You have to make sure, that the raindrops didn't fall all the way down, because then they would ruin the newly painted beachhouses, so you had to click on the drops to make them go away. However, you shouldn't click on the sunshine, because it would help to dry the paint.<br> <br>In the making of this project I learned about SVG's, a little about css-animations and how to use keyframes.<br> <br>This was also my first real introduction to JavaScript, and how you could use it to add a class and remove it again. We also had to use JavaScript to set the time of the game. This was also my first encounter with if-statements, which I used for the counting of points and to let the game know if you had won or lost. Lastly we were introduced to math.random, which I used to make the game randomly send down the clickable elements.<br> <br></p>

                    <p class="text">This website was made as a school project. The intention with the project was to learn how to use javascript to "clean" JSON-data and for sorting and filtering in lists.<br> <br>The site is build up on imported data from a JSON-file full of Hogwarts-students. The file contained full names of the students, which "house" they belonged to, etc. However the data had to be corrected before being imported to the grid-view in the HTML - the data was both capitalized, un-capitalized, some had middlenames and some hadn't. We used 'trim', 'toLowerCase', 'indexOf', 'split' and 'substring' to clean the data. <br> <br> It also had to be possible to expell a student and thereby removing the student from the list. lastly, we had to make it possible to "hack" the list, which meant to insert yourself in the list of student and you shouldn't be able to be expelled.<br> <br></p>
